# PowerBi-Projects

## Power BI Data Analysis Projects Repository üöÄ

This repository contains a curated collection of **Business Intelligence (BI)** projects developed using **Microsoft Power BI**. Each project demonstrates a professional, end-to-end data analysis workflow‚Äîfrom connecting to raw data through to delivering fully interactive, executive-ready dashboards.

## Project Workflow and Core Components üìã

The projects are structured to showcase proficiency across the entire BI development lifecycle, leveraging Power BI's powerful ecosystem:

### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query) üßπ
* **Source Connectivity:** Connecting to diverse data sources (e.g., SQL, Excel, Web APIs).
* **Data Shaping (ETL):** Employing the **Power Query Editor** to clean and transform messy data. Techniques include:
    * Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
    * Pivoting and Unpivoting tables for normalization.
    * Merging and Appending queries to create master datasets.
* **Automation:** Building repeatable transformation steps that refresh automatically with new source data.

### 2. Data Modeling (Power Pivot) üèóÔ∏è
* **Schema Design:** Establishing optimal table structures (Star/Snowflake schema) for efficient analysis.
* **Relationships:** Defining and managing relationships between tables for accurate data filtering and aggregation.
* **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implementing basic security measures (where applicable) to restrict data visibility based on user roles.

### 3. Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) üß†
* **Measures and Metrics:** Creating advanced analytical calculations using the **DAX formula language**. Key DAX concepts demonstrated include:
    * **Time Intelligence:** Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth, Moving Averages.
    * **Context Transition:** Utilizing `CALCULATE` to manipulate filter contexts.
    * **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Defining custom metrics (e.g., Conversion Rate, Profit Margin) essential for business monitoring.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Insights Extraction üîç
* **Visual Exploration:** Utilizing various charts and graphs to identify trends, outliers, and patterns in the data.
* **Segmentation:** Analyzing data across different dimensions (e.g., region, product, time) to reveal underlying drivers.
* **Actionable Findings:** Translating complex data patterns into clear, concise, and **actionable business insights** and recommendations.

### 5. Interactive Dashboard Development üñ•Ô∏è
* **Data Visualization:** Designing clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing reports and dashboards.
* **Interactivity:** Implementing key Power BI features to enhance user exploration:
    * **Slicers and Filters:** Allowing users to dynamically adjust the data view.
    * **Drill-Through/Drill-Down:** Enabling navigation from summary views to detailed transaction data.
    * **Report Page Tooltips:** Providing deeper context on visual elements.
* **Storytelling:** Arranging visuals in a logical flow to tell a compelling, data-driven story that addresses the business objective.

## How to Explore the Projects üó∫Ô∏è

Each folder in this repository represents a complete Power BI project and typically contains the following files:

1.  **`Project Name.pbix`**: The primary Power BI Desktop file containing the data model, DAX measures, and all visualizations. **(Recommended start point)**
2.  **`Source Data/`**: (If necessary) A subfolder containing sample source data (Excel, CSV, etc.) used for the project build. 

---

## Technical Requirements and Dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è

To fully explore and interact with the dashboards, you will need:

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** The free application for building and viewing Power BI files.
* **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (or running on a virtual environment for Mac users).
