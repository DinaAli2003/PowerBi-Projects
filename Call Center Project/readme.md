# Call Center Project (PowerBI)

# üìû Project README: Call Center Performance & CX Dashboard

---

### 1. Project Title: **Customer Experience (CX) & Operations Analyzer** üöÄ

### 2. Overview üí°

This project is a powerful, interactive **Call Center Analytics Dashboard** solution built using a data visualization platform (e.g., Power BI). Its primary function is to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of **Call Center Operations, Channel Performance,** and **Customer Experience (CX)** metrics. By integrating operational efficiency with customer feedback, the tool enables management to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and drive immediate service improvements.

### 3. Key Objectives üéØ

The dashboard is designed to meet the following strategic and operational needs:

* **Service Demand Analysis:** Track **Average Calls per Day** and analyze call volume distribution by **Day, Week of Month,** and **Geographic State.**
* **Customer Experience (CX) Monitoring:** Measure and benchmark **Average Customer Satisfaction Score** and analyze the distribution of different **feedback** types.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Monitor **Average Call Duration** and analyze **Response Time** across different Call Center locations.
* **Channel Strategy:** Evaluate the performance and volume of different service channels (**Call Center, Chatbot, Email, Web**) to optimize resource investment.
* **Reason & Resolution Insight:** Identify the **highest volume reasons** for customer calls (Billing, Payments, Service Outage).

### 4. Dashboard Breakdown & Key Insights üìä

The solution is divided into two highly functional dashboards:

#### Dashboard 1: Operational Efficiency & Daily Flow ‚è±Ô∏è

This view focuses on the day-to-day rhythm of the call center and core performance metrics.

| Visualization | Core Metrics & Insights |
| :--- | :--- |
| **KPI Scorecard** | **Average Calls per Day (e.g., 1.10K), Average Customer Satisfaction Score (e.g., 5.52),** and **Average of Call Duration (e.g., 25.02).** |
| **Which Reason of Call is the Highest?** | Bar chart identifying the most frequent call topics (e.g., Billing Question). |
| **Count of Response Time by Call-Centres** | Bar chart comparing the responsiveness of different Call Center locations (e.g., Los Angeles, Baltimore, etc.). |
| **# of Calls per Day** | Line chart showing the weekly trend of call volume (identifying peak/off-peak days). |
| **Top 5 Cities in terms of AVG Call Duration** | Donut chart benchmarking service efficiency across key city locations. |
| **Customer Satisfaction Score** | Treemap showing the distribution of various satisfaction scores. |

---

#### Dashboard 2: Channel Performance & Customer Feedback ‚ù§Ô∏è

This view focuses on channel utilization, geographic demand, and the qualitative assessment of customer service.

| Visualization | Core Metrics & Insights |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Average Calls for every State (Map)** | Geospatial map showing call volume demand across different states/regions. |
| **# of Calls for every channel** | Bar chart comparing the total volume across all service channels (Call Center, Chatbot, Email, Web). |
| **Customer Satisfaction Score for every Channel** | Pie chart showing the proportional contribution of each channel to the overall satisfaction metric. |
| **Which feedback is the highest?** | Bar chart analyzing the distribution of customer feedback types (Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive). |
| **Total Calls per Week of Month** | Horizontal bar chart tracking call volume across the weeks of a month (identifying monthly load cycles). |

### 5. Interactivity and Usage üñ±Ô∏è

The Call Center Dashboard is built for dynamic analysis, leveraging **Slicers and Cross-Filtering** to allow users to investigate data layers immediately.

**Key Functionality:**

* **Slicers (Left Panel):** Use **State** and **Channel** slicers to focus the entire report on specific geographies or service methods.
* **Cross-Filtering:** Clicking on any element (e.g., selecting 'Email' in the channel bar chart) will instantly filter **all other visuals** on both dashboards to show the duration, satisfaction, and geographic demand specific to Email.
* **Drill Down:** Users can click into specific regions on the map or categories in charts for deeper insight.

**How to Use:**
1.  Open the **"Call Center project"** file.
2.  Navigate between **'Dashboard 1'** and **'Dashboard 2'** tabs.
3.  Use the **Slicers** on the left to select a specific **State** or **Channel** for focused analysis.
4.  Interact with the charts to filter data and immediately gain insights into operational or customer experience performance.
