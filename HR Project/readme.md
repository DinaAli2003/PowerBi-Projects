---

### 1. Project Title: **Workforce Dynamics & Talent Insights Dashboard** üöÄ

### 2. Overview üí°

This project presents a comprehensive **Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard** built using Power BI (or similar visualization tool, as suggested by the interface). The primary goal is to transform complex HR data into clear, interactive, and actionable insights, enabling strategic talent management and operational efficiency. The dashboard is structured across three main views: **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Dashboard 1 (Operational & Demographics),** and **Dashboard 2 (Engagement & Satisfaction).**

### 3. Key Objectives üéØ

The dashboard is designed to fulfill the following strategic HR needs:

* **Talent Acquisition & Retention:** Analyze **Attrition Rate** and track employee tenure to identify retention challenges.
* **Compensation & Career Progression:** Monitor **Average Monthly Income, Salary Hike Percentage,** and **Promotion Cycles.**
* **Workforce Demographics:** Understand the distribution of employees by **Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education,** and **Department.**
* **Employee Engagement:** Measure and track key satisfaction metrics, including **Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction,** and **Environment Satisfaction.**
* **Performance Management:** Track employee **Performance Rating** and **Job Involvement Levels.**

### 4. Dashboard Breakdown & Key Insights üìä

The solution is divided into three functional screens:

#### KPIs: The Executive Summary üåü

This screen provides high-level, aggregate metrics for quick executive review.

| Key Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Employee Number** | Total active headcount. |
| **AVG Monthly Income** | Benchmark compensation level. |
| **AVG Age** | Demographic center of the workforce (e.g., 37). |
| **AVG Companies Worked** | Indicator of workforce stability/mobility (e.g., 3). |

### 5. Interactivity and Usage üñ±Ô∏è

The HR Dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to **filter all data points** simultaneously using the available filters and slicers.

**Key Functionality:**

* **Drill Down/Cross-Filter:** Clicking on a segment in any chart (e.g., "Director" in Job Level) will instantly filter all other visuals to show the demographics, performance, and satisfaction metrics **only** for that selected group.
* **Filtering by Attribute:** Use the **Filters** pane on the right (attributes like Gender, Marital Status, Education) to focus the analysis on specific employee cohorts.

**How to Use:**
1.  Open the **"HR Project"** file in your visualization software (e.g., Power BI Desktop or Service).
2.  Navigate between the **'KPIs,' 'Dashboard 1,'** and **'Dashboard 2'** tabs at the bottom.
3.  Click on any visual segment or use the filter pane to perform immediate, cross-sectional analysis.
